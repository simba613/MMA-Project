        <p>“5 was the magic number for me. 5 genuinely good property deals can set you free. 5 unlocks you from the burden of the rat race. They become your financial cushion. They embolden you to take on a little more risk on the sixth... because now they're no longer make-or-break deals. Now it becomes fun. Now you start living for the next deal.”

          <p>The quote above is the answer to a question I was asked a few years back. Somebody had asked me when I felt the momentum really start building in my own investing, because it's true, there comes a point when one or two deals a year suddenly becomes ten or twenty.</p>

          <p>And on reflection, five was the magic number for me.</p>

          <p>I call this the "hump". The first few deals are a grind, you wonder if it's always going to be this hard, and then boom, you get some momentum and you are off to the races.</p>

          <p>Mastermind Accelerator exists solely to get you over the hump.</p>

          <p>In every respect, the Accelerator workshop is designed to give you momentum in your property investing. </p>
          <ul class="spaced-li">
          <li>Three days is the perfect amount of time to ensure comprehensive instruction, while still keeping the big picture front and centre in your mind. You make connections between topics much more easily.</li>

          <li>We made it a residential workshop. This helps maximise instruction time. But the biggie is it helps you get physical distance from your day-to-day life for several days. My best business ideas have always come while on vacation. Similarly, taking a step back from your daily life and immersing yourself in this workshop for three days completely opens up your mind.</li>

          <li>The workshop is run from Thursday to Saturday, giving you Sunday to start on your action plan. Nothing destroys momentum like having to go to work the next day.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>As a result - and even though I don't hold many of them - the Accelerator workshops are some of my favourite days of the year. The energy levels in the room are through the roof, and it is incredibly rewarding to watch a group grow so much over our three days together.</p>

          <p><strong>How the Accelerator workshop came to be. And why should you care?</strong></p>
          <p>The Workshop itself started life as a private get-together for my Mastermind group, prior to them embarking on their 12-month Mastermind Programme.</p>
          <p>My 12-month Mastermind Programme is now almost 10 years old. My 20th cohort will soon be graduating. It has created countless property millionaires from all walks of life. It is my proudest achievement.</p>
          <p>But way back in the first few cohorts, one thing was really bugging me...</p>
          <p>The feedback from my students was great, the energy during our monthly meetups was great, everybody was attending the weekly webinar calls...</p>
          <p>But still, many of my Masterminders were often taking 6, 7, 8 months before figuratively hitting the runway and taking off with their property businesses.</p>
          <p>This was too long in my book. I wanted to ramp up their property businesses in weeks, not months.</p>
          <p>My epiphany came during one of our Mastermind lunches. Speaking candidly with a few members, it dawned on me that they were holding off on fully committing until they had visited each and every investing strategy that was due to be covered during the 12-month Programme.</p>
          <p>In other words, they were hesitating for fear of missing out on alternative, potentially better investing strategies. They were waiting for the whole picture before pulling the trigger on deals.</p>
          <p>It was then that I decided I needed to get everybody together, lock them all in a room for a weekend, and cover the complete Mastermind syllabus from start to end...</p>
          <p><strong>And so, the Accelerator workshop was born...</strong></p>
          <p>It was a huge hit. It removed a large amount of initial overwhelm and it also eradicated the fear of missing out on investing strategies covered later on in the Programme.</p>
          <p>With the roaring success of the Accelerator weekend, it was an easy decision to begin offering it as a stand-alone workshop outside of the Mastermind Programme itself.
          <p class="text-center"><strong>The upshot?</strong></p>
          <p class="text-center"><strong>You get access to the Mastermind syllabus without the heavy commitment of enrolling on the full programme.</strong></p>

          <p>As we head into the latter end of 2016, sentiment is one of uncertainty.</p>
          <p>And this is fantastic news.</p>
          <p>If you've known me for any length of time, you know I am a big advocate of stepping up your game as others are leaving it.</p>
          <p>Professional investors make money in up, down and sideways markets. And the very best deals are to be had when the masses stay home and sit on their hands.</p>
