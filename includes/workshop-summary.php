        <h3>WORKSHOP SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>The Mastermind Accelerator is an intensive workshop for investors seeking to aggressively build out their property portfolio over the next twelve months, regardless of starting capital.</p>
        <ul class="spaced-li">
          <li>Spend three days with Simon Zutshi as he takes you into the "inner sanctum" of how he, and his renowned Mastermind group, are investing right now.</li>
          <li>Cover the complete Mastermind investing framework - a comprehensive roadmap which effortlessly guides you to the optimal investing strategy for any deal scenario.</li>
          <li>Get access to our confidential "27 motivated seller sources" - uncover leads from the unlikeliest of places.</li>
          <li>Spend an entire day on how to find the most motivated of sellers, and how to systemise finding them.</li>
          <li>"No money down" investing taken to the next level. Keep the best leads for yourself, learn how to package up and sell the rest.</li>
          <li>PIN coaches on-hand throughout the workshop to tailor the best investing approach to your circumstances.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is your only chance of inside access to this material, short of being a fully pledged member of the Mastermind group - something which comes at considerable expense and commitment.</p>
        <p>Likewise, this is the only chance to spend a dedicated chunk of time with Simon Zutshi outside of the Mastermind group itself. You are getting full access to him and his expertise.</p>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> this workshop is not for the "weekend investor". It covers hands-on investing approaches that require commitment and perseverance. Stunning returns can be made, but you must be prepared to put the work in.</p>
