          <p>This is where it starts. Get over that hump. Do this for yourself, for your loved ones and for your legacy. Don’t look back in 5 or 10 years time thinking ‘if only I’d started back then’.</p>

            <h3 class="m-t-0 m-b text-center m-b-lg">The A4 Piece Of Paper At The Heart Of The Workshop...</h3>
            <img src="img/accelerator-flowchart-blurred.png" class="img-responsive m-b-md">
            <p>On the morning of the first day of the workshop, you will be handed a piece of paper with a flowchart on it.</p>
            <p>Do not lose that piece of paper. Study it, immerse yourself in it, cherish it, laminate it if you have to. Do whatever it takes to internalise the underlying theories and applications of the flowchart.</p>
            <p>Why? Because it is going to become your investing roadmap for years to come.</p>
            <p>During the course of operating your property business, property leads are going to land on your desk...</p>
            <p>What happens after that lead has landed distinguishes the professional investor from the amateur investor. The flowchart is always there to guide you to the optimal investing outcome for every single eventuality.</p>
            <p>By following the flowchart and answering each Yes/No question, you automatically arrive at the best outcome for that lead.
            <p>Examples of scenarios the flowchart answers:
            <ul>
            <li>Should you buy the property?</li>
            <li>Is it suitable for an HMO?</li>
            <li>Is a purchase option preferrable to outright purchase?</li>
            <li>When does Rent to Rent become viable?</li>
            <li>Should I package up the lead and sell it on?</li>
            <li>What should the exit strategy be?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These questions, and a dozen others, are answered for you by the flowchart. The beauty is in its simplicity.</p>

            <h4>1. The Flowchart Eliminates Overwhelm</h4>
            <p>During the workshop itself, the flowchart provides the foundation for instruction. It eliminates overwhelm because you have the visual representation of the strategies there in front of you at all times.</p>
            <h4>2. The Flowchart Helps You Monetize Your Leads</h4>
            <p>You are not going to purchase every property lead that lands on your desk. Some will not fit your criteria and for others the timing will not be right.</p>
            <p>The flowchart quickly guides you to alternative cashflow strategies. So in addition to executing on those hot leads that tick all the boxes, you are leveraging opportunities on those luke-warm leads that most amateur investors pass up on.</p>
            <p>By monetising a greater proportion of the leads that land on your desk, you separate yourself from the investing herd.</p>
            <h4>3. The Flowchart Helps You Negotiate With Sellers</h4>
            <p>By asking a set of simple questions, you can provide a specialised solution to a motivated seller in under 2 minutes. Not only does this give you instant credibility and authority, but it is often a win-win deal structure that other potential buyers have missed.</p>

            <h3 class="m-t-0 m-b text-center m-b-lg">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <h4>What topics are covered during the 3-day Workshop?</h4>
            <p>The first half of the workshop covers how, and where, to find properties that are selling at a steep discount. This is the most important step of the entire process... sourcing private deals that other buyers/investors are simply not privy to.</p>
            <p>You will learn where the best deals are found, and how to set up systems to have these leads land regularly on your desk.</p>
            <p>The second half of the workshop covers the optimal deal structures and financing strategies for the leads that you have sourced. This is taught within the framework of our all-encompassing Accelerator Strategy Flow Chart.</p>
            <p>You will not pull the trigger on every lead you land, BUT the beauty of a lead is in the eye of the beholder. With leads you don't personally take action on yourself, you will learn how to package them up and sell them to other professional investors. These can become a significant contribution to your overall property income, or at the very least subsidise your lead sourcing efforts.</p>
            <p>Some keywords you'll hear repeatedly throughout the weekend:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>NMLI "No Money Left In" Deals</li>
              <li>Momentum Investing</li>
              <li>Purchase Options</li>
              <li>"Rent To Own" Strategies</li>
              <li>Freehold to Leasehold Strategies</li>
              <li>Assisted Sales Strategies</li>
              <li>HMO Optimisation</li>
              <li>Vendor Financing Strategies</li>
              <li>Rent to Rent Strategies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All the investing strategies are grounded in our all-encompassing one-page Mastermind Accelerator Flow Chart. </p>
            <h4>What is the Accelerator Flow Chart?</h4>
            <p>The Accelerator Flow Chart intuitively and quickly guides you to the optimal investing strategy for any deal. Outside of the 12-month Mastermind Programme itself, the Accelerator Workshop is the only place to get access to the full flow chart. It will become one of the most important tools in your investing toolkit.</p>
            <h4>What topics are not covered?</h4>
            <p>The Accelerator workshop is firmly rooted in the hands-on approach of sourcing and negotiating below market value deals directly with motivated sellers. This is where the best property deals are found.</p>
            <p>As such, the workshop does not cover the "glossy brochure" strategies such as buying off-plan, new builds or overseas properties (unless of course they happen to come at a steep discount from a motivated seller).</p>
            <p>The workshop touches on commercial property, but only within the framework of buying commercial property from a motivated seller. Converting commercial to residential is also briefly covered.</p>
            <h4>Do you need to be an advanced investor to attend?</h4>
            <p>No. As host, it is Simon Zutshi's job to take specialised investing topics and teach them in a way that is both accessible and intuitive. And he is very good at it. His method of teaching helped him build the Property Investors Network into what it is today.</p>
            <p>That said, having some grasp of common investing lingo will certainly help in your retention of the topics covered. For example, if you don't know what BMV stands for (= Below Market Value), or HMO (= House of Multiple Occupation), it might be advisable to read Simon Zutshi's book Property Magic beforehand, or attend one of his Property Investing Quickstart weekends - the cost of which can be credited from the Accelerator Workshop cost if you do decide to enroll.</p>
            <p>Even if you fall behind at times, the DVD recordings of the Workshop are always there to back you up once you are back home.</p>
            <h4>Can you bring a partner?</h4>
            <p>Yes. It can be either your spouse or a business partner. If you need an extra hotel room for them, please contact the office on 0121 228 2223.</p>
            <h4>What materials do you get during the Workshop?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The 79-Page Mastermind Accelerator Workbook.</li>
              <li>The Mastermind Accelerator flowchart - your comprehensive roadmap to analysing and evaluating deals.</li>
              <li>A 12 DVD set recording of the Mastermind Accelerator workshop for you to review and study once back home. Never miss a thing.</li>
              <li>A rolodux of my personal power team. These are the guys I rely on for my own deals, and they are fully versed in the strategies we teach (which is invaluable). </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Is the course material current for 2016?</h4>
            <p>Yes. Only strategies that pertain to the current investing environment - be it the mortgage market, regulatory environment or tax system - ever make it onto the syllabus.</p>
            <h4>What is the format of the Workshop?</h4>
            <p>It is an intensive workshop consisting of 6 hours of instruction per day, led by Simon Zutshi. Each day is broken up into several sessions, with alloted time at the end of each session for extensive Q&A. Simon will often perform live role-playing sessions where you get to watch him negotiate and structure deals with sellers in real-time.</p>
            <p>There are breakout sessions with Property Investors Network coaches to talk you through your personal investing goals and help you come up with your own roadmap for success.</p>
            <p>Outside of the formal instruction hours, there are always staff on hand to answer questions, as well as plenty of time over breakfast, lunch and dinner to discuss all things property investing.</p>
            <h4>Mastermind Programme vs Mastermind Accelerator, which to choose?</h4>
            <p>The Mastermind Programme is a fully immersive 12-month programme and requires substantial commitment. It is also quite pricey.</p>
            <p>The Mastermind Accelerator is a 3-day workshop that covers the syllabus of the Mastermind Programme in an accelerated format.</p>
            <p>Regardless of where you are in your investing journey, there is no need to choose between the two programmes. We send all of our Mastermind members on the Accelerator workshop prior to them embarking on their 12-month Programme. And if you ever decide to go on to the 12-month Programme having attended the Accelerator Workshop, the full cost of the Workshop is deducted from cost of the 12-month Programme.</p>
            <h4>How much capital do you need to get started?</h4>
            <p>We work under the assumption you have no starting capital. Why? Because eventually working capital runs out, regardless of the size of the initial pot. In order for your property business to be sustainable in the long run, you should not have to rely on your own working capital.</p>
            <p>When a property deal is good enough, money flows to it, not the other way round. As a rule of thumb, a property deal bought at a 25% discount can be structured such that you never need to put a penny of your own money into the deal.</p>
            <p>The sooner you start using outside finance, the sooner you have a fully sustainable property business.</p>
            <h4>Why is the Workshop run from Thursday to Saturday?</h4>
            <p>Because it gives you Sunday free to collect your thoughts and begin working on the action plan you created as part of the workshop. It gives you momentum rather than having to go into work the next day and having to put the stuff you learned on hold.</p>
            <h4>What post-Workshop support do you get?</h4>
            <p>You get access to a private Facebook group with all the other delegates from the workshop. Continue the discussion and networking after the workshop itself.</p>
            <p>You also get a 12 DVD set recording of the Workshop. The three days move at a fast pace, so you can review the material at your own pace once back at home.</p>
            <h4>What are the accommodation details?</h4>
            <p>Two nights accommodation - at the venue and in your own hotel room - is included in the price. It encourages everybody to stick around in the evening to socialise and network, which is an important part of the workshop experience.</p>
            <h4>Are meals included?</h4>
            <p>All meals and snacks are included for the three days. We can take into account most dietary requirements, liaise with the office once you have booked your place. Drinks are not included in the price.</p>
            <p>We can cater to most dietary requirements, just let the office know in advance.</p>
            <h4>How many times a year is the Accelerator Workshop run?</h4>
            <p>Only four times per year. The three days are quite draining on Simon, so he limits himself to four times a year in order to give you 100% of his energy and attention. As such, there are a limited number of places available each year.</p>
            <h4>What is the cost?</h4>
            <p>The price includes all instruction, all accommodation and all meals, and is £2997 + VAT.</p>
            <h4>Is there a limit on places?</h4>
            <p>Yes. Doors close when 60 people have booked their place. Workshops are held only four times a year, so they always fill up well ahead of time.</p>
            <h4>Is there a money back guarantee?</h4>
            <p>Yes. And it is the strongest in the business. If at any point up to lunchtime on the second day you decide it isn't for you, just hand back the course materials and you will be refunded the entire course cost.</p>
